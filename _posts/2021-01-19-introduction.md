Hi! My name is Saara Korhonen, and I am a gameplay programmer working at [Random Potion](http://randompotion.com/ "Random Potion"), at Tampere, Finland.

I got my start in programming back when I was 17 and studying for my vocational qualifications in IT. When I started the studies, my intention wasn't to start programming, but I gave it a go anyways
and it lit a spark in me. Today I have professional experience in C#, but I've completed some university courses in HTML & CSS, Javascript and C++.
Recently I've also dipped my toes into robotics through Arduino projects.
