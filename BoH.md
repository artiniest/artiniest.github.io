The project had been ongoing for some time already when I joined the team at Random Potion, but I had no issue jumping into it and getting myself familiarized with the codebase.

### 1st year
* Small UI, AI pathing and decision making, and character ability fixes

* Implementation of traps and other consumables
* Tweaks to procuderal generation of encounters

### 2nd year

* A complete overhaul of the character creation
* Implementation of The Dark Eye professions, including all active spells and chants, combat abilities and special abilities
* Creation of Unity Editor tools to automatize and streamline asset creation for consumables, weapons, armor etc

### The final 6 months
* Implementation of The Dark Eye passive advantages and disadvantages
* Implementation of The Dark Eye specific special abilities for enemies
